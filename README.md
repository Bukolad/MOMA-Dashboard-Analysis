# MOMA-Dashboard-Analysis
This Project involves building an interactive Power BI dashboard using datasets from the Museum of Modern Art On View (MOMA). "On View" refers to artwork that are currently exhibited in the physical gallaries of the Museum of Modern Art. The dashboard provides deep insights into artists, their artworks, and acquisition trends from 1932- 2024.
In this Dashboard, the 'On View' analysis focuses on :
- Number of artworks currently displayed.
- Artists with the most works on View
- Most common classification and mediums on display.
- Trends in artwork acqusition years
